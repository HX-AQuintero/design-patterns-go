Introduced by Robert C. Martin.
## **S**ingle Responsibility Principle (SRP)

*Separation of concerns:*  
- Different concerns that the system solves have to reside in different constructs/structs.  
- Break into packages.  

## **O**pen-Closed Principle (OCP)  
States that types should be open for extension, closed for modification.  
Uses *Specification pattern*
## **L**iskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
## **I**nterface Segregation Principle (ISP)
## **D**ependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
